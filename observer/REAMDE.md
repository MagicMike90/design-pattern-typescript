# Memento

Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

## When to use

- Use the Observer pattern when changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the actual set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.
- Use the pattern when some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.

## Comparison

- **Chain of Responsibility**, **Command**, **Mediator** and **Observer** address various ways of connecting senders and receivers of requests:
  - Chain of Responsibility passes a request sequentially along a dynamic chain of potential receivers until one of them handles it.
  - Command establishes unidirectional connections between senders and receivers.
  - Mediator eliminates direct connections between senders and receivers, forcing them to communicate indirectly via a mediator object.
  - Observer lets receivers dynamically subscribe to and unsubscribe from receiving requests.
- The difference between **Mediator** and **Observer** is often elusive. In most cases, you can implement either of these patterns; but sometimes you can apply both simultaneously. Letâ€™s see how we can do that.
